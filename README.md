## About Our Web Application
This web application, BilBoard, is a team project for our CS-319 course for the Fall 2023-2024 term. This web application aims to have four main features: secondhand sales, lost and found, borrow, and donation. Each feature is aimed at solving some common problems among Bilkent University students. Also, this web application can only be used by the Bilkent students.

What motivates us to create such a project is that this web application will solve one of the biggest problems for Bilkent students: not having secure media for exchanging personal belongings. Students use unofficial Instagram accounts or WhatsApp groups to sell their secondhand stuff, post lost and found items, borrow things for a short time, and make donations.

## Features of BilBoard 
### Secondhand Sales 
For the secondhand sales feature, for example, every year, students try to find some secondhand stuff from the upper classes, such as books or tech devices like Basys 3. With the help of this application, they can easily reach each other and buy/sell their items. This will be way more easier than texting to the huge WhatsApp groups to find those people since this app will directly target sellers and buyers according to the specific product.

### Lost and Found Items 
For the lost and found feature, our school doesn't have such a system that students can check their lost stuff. As stated earlier, students use unofficial social media accounts to address lost items or leave the found item to the security officers, or sometimes, they don't even know what to do when they find a lost item and leave it as is. Rather than reaching some unofficial Instagram pages or leaving it to security officers until the owner comes, lost items can be addressed to the students from a common web page, and it will be safer than reaching an unofficial Instagram page.

### Borrowing 
Our third feature, "Borrow," can be useful for short-term needed pieces, and it will strengthen the community feeling and solidarity among Bilkent University students. For example, sometimes we have open book exams and some of the books are really expensive. If a student just wants to bring the book to the exam, they can borrow it from someone else for just 3 hours. Also, in some exams, calculators are allowed, but buying an expensive calculator just for a couple of exams can be a waste for some students. Instead of buying a new one, they can again borrow it from someone. However, since we don't have such a platform, students send messages in WhatsApp groups in the hope of finding a person who has the needed item. Instead, with our borrowing feature, students will be able to borrow the items they need for a short time more securely and quickly.

### Donation 
In our latest feature, "Donation," we address a common challenge students face: certain books, devices, or equipment they use regularly can't be sold second-hand or simply aren't worth selling. Currently, there needs to be a platform that facilitates or simplifies this process for them. With our website's donation feature, students can effortlessly connect with those who would benefit from the items they wish to donate. This feature not only helps reduce the waste of items students no longer find valuable but also offers financial relief to the recipients.

## Why use BilBoard?
Users might question this application's usefulness before using it. However, we are confident that our web application will benefit most of the Bilkent students. As we stated in the previous sections, this web application can only be used by Bilkent students. So, BilBoard will be a secure place for Bilkent students to buy or sell secondhand stuff, post notices for lost items, borrow things that will be needed for a short amount of time, and donate things that are in good condition but not profitable. Also, the posts on our application will have a specific target group. As opposed to Instagram posts or WhatsApp messages, where the posts reach many people instead of a target group, our users will be students who are interested in exchanging belongings. Hence, this will accelerate the process of reaching someone interested in the item that we want to sell/buy, borrow, donate, or find.
